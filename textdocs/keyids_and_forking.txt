keyids and forking.


keyids:

keyids are the basis of scripted events, and complex interactives.
a keyid is eather present or absent. (this is used as a boolean value)
REMEMBER: keyids are global in the game. so keyid changes on one page have effect all others.
all core objects have optional "onkey" and "offkey" attributes.(each specifying a keyid.)
-if onkey is specified. the player must have obtained that keyID!
-if offkey is specified. the player must *NOT* obtained that keyID!
-if neither are specified. that core object will be honored regardless.
-if BOTH onkey and offkey are specified, The player must have the keyid specified in onkey, and must NOT have the keyid specified in offkey.
Also, all clickable core objects have the following optional attributes:
-keyid: gives a specified keyid on-click
-takekey: takes a specified keyid on-click
-hoverkey: given if mouse curser is hovered over object, actively removed if it isn't.


Forks:
forks are events triggered on certain keyid conditions.

-unlike keyids, forks are page specific. located within the "forks" section of each page xml. refer to included test pages for examples. 

background forks (mainly scripting logic):

<batchtrig keyid="PUZdoor"> <!--note the master keyid that is toggled.-->
	<k if="0" keyid="PUZswitch1"/> <!--#keyid PUZswitch1 must be absent-->
	<k if="1" keyid="PUZswitch2"/> <!--#keyid PUZswitch2 must be present-->
	<k if="1" keyid="PUZswitch3"/> <!--#keyid PUZswitch2 must be present-->
</batchtrig>

each keyid specified in a k tag is either given to, or taken (if set="0") from, the player's keyid list.
<batchset keyid="PUZreset" set="0"> <!--see 1-->
	<k keyid="PUZswitch1"/> 
	<k keyid="PUZswitch2"/> 
	<k keyid="PUZswitch3"/>
</batchset>
<!--1: note the master keyid witch must be present for the batchset to occur.-->
