		basically translates that mouse coordinate to the oposing side of the screen.
		also note that warptest1.jpg is 2x the size of the screen. and it is a x,y panoramic style image.
		(you can use the lens distortion tool in GIMP for simple images) 
		you can also use a very wide panoramic camera in 3D software like blender
		also turning off BGimg in pageconf can speed up rendering.-->
